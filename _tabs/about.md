## Research Experience

### Domain Adaptation for Industrial Surface Defect Detection

> 2022-07 ~ Present

- Deal with small-sample problems in industrial surface defect detection.
- Proposed a plug-and-play lightweight module to enhance model's robustness to diverse source data while minimizing impact on the original model's inference speed.
- Further developed a module capable of extracting domain-specific representations with explicit semantics, enhancing the model's resilience to diverse styles of images.

### Precision Error Compensation of Lithography Stage using Mathematical Modeling

> 2021-10 ~ 2022-06

Enhancing the precision of lithography processes in semiconductor manufacturing by leveraging mathematical modeling techniques to address the challenge of compensating for positional errors in the lithography stage.
